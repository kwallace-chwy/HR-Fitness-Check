# Snowflake Discovery Results

Status: Draft discovery results
Last updated: 2026-07-15

Identifier note: `V1-###` references below are legacy discovery IDs from the older 27-row snapshot. Use the crosswalk in `knowledge-base/ingestion-backlog.md`; do not use legacy or current draft IDs for production joins until the stable catalog is approved.

## Working Local Solution

Use the existing Workload Lens Python virtual environment and read-only query runner for `EDLDB` / `UKG` discovery:

- Python venv: `C:\Users\kwallace12\OneDrive - Chewy.com, LLC\Desktop\Codex ORBIT\Workload Lens\.venv`
- Query runner: `C:\Users\kwallace12\OneDrive - Chewy.com, LLC\Desktop\Codex ORBIT\Workload Lens\scripts\run_snowflake_query.py`
- Config: `C:\Users\kwallace12\OneDrive - Chewy.com, LLC\Desktop\Codex ORBIT\Workload Lens\config\snowflake.toml`

The config uses browser SSO through Okta. No credential value is stored in the Fitness Check repository.

Important boundary: HR DataMart is a different Snowflake environment/profile. The working Workload Lens config should be treated as the `EDLDB` / UKG profile, not as the HRDM connection.

## Confirmed Session Context

The smoke test succeeded with:

- Role: `PEOPLE_ANALYTICS_DEVELOPER`
- Warehouse: `PEOPLE_ANALYTICS_WH`
- Database: `EDLDB`
- Schema: `PEOPLE_ANALYTICS_SANDBOX`
- Secondary roles: `FULFILLMENT_OPTIMIZATION_DEVELOPER`, `OTH_USER`, `DBT_DEMO_DEVELOPER`

View-layer equivalents also exist, including:

- `V_TIMECARD_EXCEPTION`
- `V_SCHEDULE_TOTAL`
- `V_SCHEDULE_TRANSACTION`
- `V_SCHEDULE_SHIFT`

## V1 Items This Unlocks First

These items can move from source family research into table/field mapping using the generated EDLDB/UKG metadata:

- V1-003 Missing Time Stamps
- V1-005 13h Report
- V1-006 60h Report
- V1-007 Lunch Punch review
- V1-015 VTO Process, if UKG is used for VTO request/action data
- V1-025 Audit schedule groups

These may also benefit indirectly:

- V1-004 Unscheduled, if Roster Health can be rebuilt from UKG schedule/worked-hour data
- V1-011 Attendance Management, if Bubble/attendance source logic is confirmed against UKG

## HRDM Profile Validation

The HR DataMart profile was created locally outside this repository and validated through browser SSO on 2026-06-19.

- Local HRDM config: `C:\Users\kwallace12\OneDrive - Chewy.com, LLC\Desktop\Codex ORBIT\Workload Lens\config\snowflake_hrdm.toml`
- Account/environment: `CHEWY-CHEWYHR`
- Role: `HRDATA_STANDARD_ROLE`
- Warehouse: `USERS_WH`
- Database: `D_HRDATAMART`
- Default schema: `S_ANALYTICS`
- Authenticator: `externalbrowser`

The first attempt using the short user value failed because the IdP session user differed from the configured Snowflake user. The config was corrected by copying the already-working SSO user identifier from the existing Workload Lens profile without printing it.

Accessible HRDM schemas found:

- `S_ADMIN`
- `S_ANALYTICS`
- `S_BRIDGE`
- `S_CORNERSTONE`
- `S_CURATED`
- `S_GREENHOUSE`
- `S_HYPERION`
- `S_LMS`
- `S_REFERENCE`
- `S_WORKDAY`

## HRDM Objects Confirmed In Metadata

High-value HRDM objects found for Fitness Check source mapping:

- `D_HRDATAMART.S_ANALYTICS.ROSTER_DAY_END`
- `D_HRDATAMART.S_ANALYTICS.ROSTER_WEEK_END`
- `D_HRDATAMART.S_ANALYTICS.ROSTER_PERIOD_END`
- `D_HRDATAMART.S_CURATED.ROSTER_WEEK_END`
- `D_HRDATAMART.S_CURATED.ROSTER_PERIOD_END`
- `D_HRDATAMART.S_WORKDAY.WD_DATAMARTFEED`
- `D_HRDATAMART.S_WORKDAY.WD_DATAMARTFEED_TRENDED`
- `D_HRDATAMART.S_WORKDAY.WORKDAY_TRENDED`
- `D_HRDATAMART.S_WORKDAY.V_WORKDAY_TRENDED`
- `D_HRDATAMART.S_ANALYTICS.WORKDAY_TRENDED_MANAGER_HIERARCHY`
- `D_HRDATAMART.S_WORKDAY.WD_LOCATION`
- `D_HRDATAMART.S_WORKDAY.WD_SECURITY`

## User-Discovered HRDM Object Lead

The 2026-07-07 MAIA missed-punch correction discovery added this HRDM source lead:

- `D_HRDATAMART.S_ANALYTICS.EMPLOYEE_BADGING`

Use case: directional badge IN/OUT scans by employee, site, and date for HRA-reviewed missed-punch recommendation research. This should be treated as corroborating evidence only. Badge scans are access events, not payroll punches, and must not drive autonomous UKG edits.

Useful LOA fields were found in Workday/roster objects:

- `LOA`
- `LOA_TYPE`
- `LOA_REFERENCE_ID`
- `LOA_FLAG`

## HRDM Gaps Found

The metadata search did not find obvious beneficiary, emergency-contact, dependent, or benefit-completeness fields in the broad HRDM column search or the priority object column inventory.

The HRDM ServiceNow search returned zero rows for expected table names and patterns such as `sn_hr_core_case`, `sn_hr_core_task`, `SNOW`, and HR case/task names. This means SNOW Tickets and LOAA Management still need a ServiceNow replication schema, alternate database, or source-owner confirmation.

No Talent Management table or column names matched obvious `LEW`, `Quality`, `One on One`, or `Talent` patterns in the searched HRDM schemas. Quality 1:1 and LEWs still need Tableau/EPA source-owner mapping.

## V1 Items This Unlocks First

These items can now move from environment-blocked to table/field mapping:

- V1-004 Unscheduled, using HRDM roster objects with UKG/CLMS validation still required.
- V1-011 Attendance Management, using HRDM roster objects if Bubble/attendance logic maps there.
- V1-016 Ensure site TMs have listed beneficiaries, only after Workday/HRDM owner identifies the field/report because no obvious column was found by name.
- V1-017 Ensure site TMs have listed emergency contacts, only after Workday/HRDM owner identifies the field/report because no obvious column was found by name.

These remain blocked by missing source schema or governance:

- V1-001 SNOW Tickets.
- V1-002 LOAA Management.
- V1-019 Quality 1:1.
- V1-020 LEWs.
- V1-026 Investigations.
