Status: Draft discovery artifact
Last updated: 2026-08-10

## Source Status Legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Located | A credible source artifact, system path, table, or pipeline was found. |
| Candidate | A likely source was found, but table/field-level mapping is not confirmed. |
| Blocked | Source family is known, but access, connector, table metadata, or governance prevents ingestion planning. |
| Manual | Evidence appears to require physical inspection or human judgment. |

## Core Platform Sources

| Source family | Status | Located evidence | Ingestion relevance |
|---|---|---|---|
| HR DataMart / Snowflake | Located, profile validated, metadata discovery started | Confluence: EPA - HR Datamart (Snowflake) Overview; Workday HRDM page; HR Datamart onboarding/security references; HRDM SSO validation output | Primary target for Workday-derived roster and people fields. Production database `D_HRDATAMART` is accessible through a separate HRDM profile. Visible schemas include `S_ANALYTICS`, `S_CURATED`, `S_GREENHOUSE`, `S_REFERENCE`, and `S_WORKDAY`. |
| Workday to HRDM | Located, field discovery started | Confluence: Workday HRDM pipeline page; HRDM metadata output | Workday current and trended objects are visible, including `S_WORKDAY.WD_DATAMARTFEED`, `S_WORKDAY.WD_DATAMARTFEED_TRENDED`, `S_WORKDAY.WORKDAY_TRENDED`, and `S_WORKDAY.V_WORKDAY_TRENDED`. First-pass metadata did not find obvious beneficiary or emergency-contact columns. |
| UKG Pro to Snowflake | Located, metadata discovery started | Confluence: EDS - UKG Pro Data Ingestion into Snowflake; UKG Data Pipeline; Snowflake metadata query output | Candidate source for timecard, schedule, accrual, missed punch, meal break, 13h, 60h, schedule group, and VTO/VET metrics. Current role can query `EDLDB.UKG` metadata. |
| ServiceNow to HR DataMart | Located in documentation, not found in HRDM metadata search | Confluence: ServiceNow Data Replication into HR DataMart; ServiceNow Data Ingestion Progress; HRDM metadata output | Candidate source for SNOW Tickets and LOAA Management. Expected tables `sn_hr_core_case` and `sn_hr_core_task` did not appear in the HRDM first-pass table-name search, so the actual replication schema/database still needs source-owner confirmation. |
| FC HR Analytics | Located | Confluence: FC HR Analytics Documentation | Critical map of existing HR Packet, Roster Health, ECHO, New Hire Survey, Smartsheet roster, VET/VTO, and CAT snapshot pipelines. Includes GitHub repository lead: `https://github.com/Chewy-Inc/fc_hr_analytics`. |
| SharePoint / OperationsHR | Located | OperationsHR site, SOP folders, HR Reports, UKG Pro, ECHO, SNOW, Investigations, Workday Documents | Best source for SOPs, process definitions, evidence of workflow, and some tracker/workbook artifacts. Not always the durable analytical source. |
| Tableau | Candidate | HR Daily Packet, Roster Health Assessment, ECHO Dashboard, VOC Dashboard, New Hire Experience Survey Report, Talent Management Dashboard references | Useful for reconciliation and source-owner discovery. Prefer underlying Snowflake/ETL sources for ingestion. |

## Snowflake And Data Mart Candidates

| Area | Candidate object | Evidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| UKG timecard totals | `EDLDB.UKG.GOLD_V_TIMECARD_TOTAL` | Confluence: UKG Data Pipeline | Reported lag about 5 hours in the source page. Useful for total hours, 60h, 13h, and timecard-derived metrics after field validation. |
| UKG timecard transactions | `EDLDB.UKG.GOLD_V_TIMECARD_TRANSACTIONS` | Confluence: UKG Data Pipeline | Candidate for punch/meal break and missing timestamp details. |
| UKG schedule total | `EDLDB.UKG.GOLD_V_SCHEDULE_TOTAL` | Confluence: UKG Data Pipeline | Candidate for scheduled hours and schedule completeness. |
| UKG schedule transactions | `EDLDB.UKG.GOLD_V_SCHEDULE_TRANSACTIONS` | Confluence: UKG Data Pipeline | Candidate for schedule-group and shift-level validation. |
| UKG accrual balance summary | `EDLDB.UKG.GOLD_V_ACCRUAL_BALANCE_SUMMARY` | Confluence: UKG Data Pipeline | Candidate for UTO/accrual context if needed by Attendance Management. |
| UKG people | `vPeople`, possibly `EDLDB.UKG.GOLD_V_PEOPLE` | Confluence: EDS UKG ingestion page; LP Troubleshooting search result | Candidate for roster/person attributes. Exact Snowflake table needs confirmation. |
| Workday current feed | `D_HRDATAMART.S_WORKDAY.WD_DATAMARTFEED` | Confluence: Workday HRDM page; HRDM metadata output | Current employee details. Useful fields include employee, worker, location, hire, manager, and LOA fields. Beneficiary and emergency-contact fields were not found by obvious names. |
| Workday trended feed | `D_HRDATAMART.S_WORKDAY.WD_DATAMARTFEED_TRENDED`, `D_HRDATAMART.S_WORKDAY.WORKDAY_TRENDED`, `D_HRDATAMART.S_WORKDAY.V_WORKDAY_TRENDED` | Confluence: Workday HRDM page; HRDM metadata output | Historical employee details. Use for quarter snapshots if needed. Beneficiary and emergency-contact fields were not found by obvious names. |
| HR analytics roster | `D_HRDATAMART.S_ANALYTICS.ROSTER_DAY_END`, `ROSTER_WEEK_END`, `ROSTER_PERIOD_END`; `D_HRDATAMART.S_CURATED.ROSTER_WEEK_END`, `ROSTER_PERIOD_END` | Confluence: EPA HR Datamart overview; HRDM metadata output | Useful for site roster denominator, location/site mapping, LOA flags, worker attributes, and rollup context. |
| HRDM employee badging | `D_HRDATAMART.S_ANALYTICS.EMPLOYEE_BADGING` | User-discovered HRDM badge scan worksheet and SQL seed, 2026-07-07 | Candidate corroborating source for directional IN/OUT badge scans by employee, site, and date. Useful for MAIA missed-punch recommendation research for BNA1, DFW8, SDF2, and SDF4 after governance approval. Badge scans are not payroll punches. |
| ServiceNow case | `sn_hr_core_case` expected, not found | Confluence: ServiceNow Data Replication into HR DataMart; HRDM metadata output | Unique key is case number per source page. HRDM first-pass search returned zero matching tables; source owner must provide actual production schema or alternate database. |
| ServiceNow task | `sn_hr_core_task` expected, not found | Confluence: ServiceNow Data Replication into HR DataMart; HRDM metadata output | Unique key is task number per source page. HRDM first-pass search returned zero matching tables; source owner must provide actual production schema or alternate database. |
